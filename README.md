**GenoSieve** is a Python tool for the intelligent subsampling of large genomic sequence datasets. It strategically reduces a dataset to a target size while ensuring the subset is both **representative** (preserving geographic and temporal distributions) and **genetically diverse** (maximizing sequence variability).

This tool is designed for researchers in genomic epidemiology, virology, and evolutionary biology who need to create meaningful, high-quality subsets for phylogenetic inference, modeling, or other computationally intensive analyses.

## ü§î Why GenoSieve?

Randomly downsampling a large dataset is fast but risky. You might lose rare variants, under-represent emerging clades, or skew the geographic distribution of your samples.

GenoSieve solves this problem by using a multi-step, objective-driven approach. It treats subsampling not as a random process, but as an **optimization problem**: finding the best possible subset that preserves the most critical information from the original data.

## üî¨ How It Works

GenoSieve follows a three-stage pipeline for each user-defined group (e.g., by month and clade):

1.  **Stratify**: The dataset is first grouped by a time period (`--date_freq`) and clade. The subsampling process runs independently on each group.
2.  **Allocate**: For each group, GenoSieve determines *how many* sequences to select from each geographic region. This allocation is proportional to the number of available sequences but can be fine-tuned with diversity-aware weights.
3.  **Select**: Finally, the tool selects the *specific* sequences from each region. It uses a **Genetic Algorithm** or a **Hybrid Heuristic** to find the most genetically diverse subset that matches the allocated size.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Smart Proportional Allocation**: Guarantees fair representation for each region using a smoothing factor (`--alpha`) and a "one-per-region" guarantee.
-   **Diversity-Weighted Allocation**: Optionally adjusts allocation to prioritize regions with higher intra-clade genetic diversity (`--use_diversity`).
-   **Advanced Diversity Maximization**:
    -   **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: A powerful optimization engine to find the subset that best satisfies a diversity objective (`--objective_function`).
    -   **Hybrid Sampling**: A fast and effective heuristic that prioritizes unique sequences (singletons).
-   **Sequence Vectorization**: Transforms sequences into numerical vectors using k-mers and TF-IDF, enabling robust distance calculations.
-   **Stratified Workflow**: Preserves the temporal and phylogenetic structure of your data by processing groups independently.
-   **Flexible Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Offers granular control over every step of the pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Requirements:**
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

Follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vcarius/genosieve.git
cd genosieve

# 2. Create the Conda environment from the YAML file
# This creates an environment named "genosieve"
conda env create -f environment.yml

# 3. Activate the environment before running the script
conda activate genosieve
```
You are now ready to run GenoSieve!

## üöÄ Usage

GenoSieve is run from the command line. The script is named `genosieve.py`.

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
python genosieve.py --METADATA <path_to_metadata.tsv> \
                    --FASTA_ALN <path_to_alignment.fasta> \
                    --target_N <samples_per_group> \
                    [OPTIONS]
```

### Example 1: Fast Hybrid Sampling (Default)

This command subsamples to 500 sequences per month/clade group using the default fast heuristic.

```bash
python genosieve.py --METADATA data/metadata.tsv \
                    --FASTA_ALN data/sequences.fasta \
                    --target_N 500 \
                    --date_freq M
```

### Example 2: Advanced Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This command uses the Genetic Algorithm to select the 300 most diverse sequences, maximizing the minimum distance between any two sequences (`--objective_function min`).

```bash
python genosieve.py --METADATA data/metadata.tsv \
                    --FASTA_ALN data/sequences.fasta \
                    --target_N 300 \
                    --use_GA \
                    --objective_function min \
                    --generations 150 \
                    --verbose
```
